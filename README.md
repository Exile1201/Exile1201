# The name is Exile1201

I'm just gonna write some thing about me, not much though

I'm a coder but not much of a pro, I have been doinf HTML, CSS and Python helping my [friend](https://top.gg/user/357835329719500802) with the [Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/737639259963392011).

Sometime I'm never an easy person when it comes to coding when I just get a bit mad when I can't fix a dam problem
